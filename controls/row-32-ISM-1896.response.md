## Summary

Memory integrity is a virtualization-based security (VBS) feature that protects kernel-mode code integrity and the CFG bitmap.[^1] Turn on memory integrity across devices by applying Intune security baseline settings.[^2][^3] Some devices may experience compatibility issues with memory integrity; verify hardware and driver compatibility before enabling and plan remediation if needed.[^1]

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Enable Memory Integrity using the Intune security baseline to satisfy the control's ImplementationGuidance.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Not provided in source documentation. [^1]
* **Permissions/Roles:** Not provided in source documentation. [^1]
* **Dependencies:** 
  - Hardware compatibility: Memory integrity requires compatible hardware, specifically Intel Kabylake or newer with Mode-Based Execution Control, and AMD Zen 2 or newer with Guest Mode Execute Trap. [^1]
  - Azure VM caveat: For Azure VMs with Secure Boot with DMA, memory integrity will show as enabled but not running; ensure Secure Boot is chosen by using one of the supported methods. [^1]
  - Hyper-V VM prerequisites: The Hyper-V host must run at least Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10 version 1607. The Hyper-V virtual machine must be Generation 2 and running at least Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10. [^1]
  - Nested virtualization: Memory integrity and nested virtualization can be enabled at the same time. To enable the Hyper-V role on the VM, install the Hyper-V role in a Windows nested virtualization environment. [^1]
  - Device compatibility: Virtual Fibre Channel adapters are not compatible with memory integrity; before attaching, opt out of Virtualization-based security using Set-VMSecurity. [^1]
  - Pass-through disks: The AllowFullSCSICommandSet option for pass-through disks isn’t compatible with memory integrity; before configuring, opt out of Virtualization-based security using Set-VMSecurity. [^1]
