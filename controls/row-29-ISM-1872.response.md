## Summary

ISM-1872 requires enforcing phishing-resistant MFA for online services by applying authentication strengths to access policies.[^3] Adopt phishing-resistant methods such as passkeys (FIDO2), Windows Hello for Business, and certificate-based authentication, and enforce them via Conditional Access authentication strengths.[^1][^3][^5] The guidance supports workload identities, time-bound credentials, and CA enforcement to extend phishing-resistant MFA across workloads and tenants.[^1]

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Enforce phishing-resistant MFA for online services by implementing a custom Conditional Access authentication strength and requiring it for all sign-ins. Deploy phishing-resistant methods (FIDO2 passkeys, Windows Hello for Business, Platform SSO, certificate-based authentication) and enforce via Conditional Access.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** To use Conditional Access, your tenant needs to have Microsoft Entra ID P1 license.[^1]
* **Permissions/Roles:** Security Administrator (minimum) to sign in to the Entra admin center and manage authentication strengths.[^1]
* **Dependencies:** Not provided in source documentation.

## Implementation Steps

### Enforce phishing-resistant MFA for online services using authentication strength

1. Sign in to Microsoft Entra admin center as a Security Administrator. [^2]

2. Create a custom authentication strength that enforces phishing-resistant methods:

   - Navigate to Entra ID > Authentication methods > Authentication strengths.
   - Select New authentication strength.
   - Name: Phishing-Resistant MFA.
   - Under Phishing-resistant MFA, select the following methods:
     - Passkeys (FIDO2) [^3]
     - Windows Hello for Business
     - Platform SSO
     - Certificate-based authentication (CBA)
   - Save. If needed, configure advanced options for Passkeys and CBA binding (e.g., attestation, issuer/OID bindings). For context, see the phishing-resistant guidance and advanced configuration options. [^2]

3. Enforce the new authentication strength with Conditional Access:

   - Create a Conditional Access policy that targets the desired user population (e.g., administrators or privileged roles).
   - Require sign-ins to use the newly defined authentication strength (Phishing-Resistant MFA) for the selected apps (e.g., Azure portal, admin centers).
   - Add a policy to block legacy authentication for the targeted scope.
   - Save. Conditional Access policies can reference authentication strengths as part of access controls. [^2]

4. Onboard and register phishing-resistant credentials:

   - Use Temporary Access Pass (TAP) to onboard users and register phishing-resistant credentials where applicable. [^1]
   - Provide credentials such as FIDO2 security keys and/or set up Windows Hello for Business on devices. For reference on passwordless and phishing-resistant methods, see the guidance on passkeys and passwordless authentication. [^3]

5. Monitor, audit, and refine:

   - Monitor sign-in logs and CA policy results to verify adoption of phishing-resistant MFA.
   - Adjust authentication strength definitions and CA policies as needed to maintain coverage and user experience. For additional context on the benefits and considerations of phishing-resistant MFA, refer to the phishing-resistant MFA guidance. [^1]

Notes:
- Passkeys (FIDO2) are a recommended phishing-resistant factor. See the official guidance for a description of passkeys and their role in phishing-resistant authentication. [^3]
- TAP provides time-bound onboarding credentials to support secure onboarding and registration flows. [^1]
