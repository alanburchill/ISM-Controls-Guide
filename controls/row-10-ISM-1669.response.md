## Summary

Enable the ASR rule to block Office applications from injecting code into other processes to prevent code injection by Office apps. Refer to ACSC Essential Eight guidance and the ASR documentation for implementation details.[^1][^4]

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Enable the ASR rule that blocks Office applications from injecting code into other processes.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** The full ASR feature-set requires a Windows Enterprise license. [^2]
* **Licensing (recommendation):** Microsoft 365 E5 is recommended for ASR rule management and monitoring. [^4]
* **Permissions/Roles:** Not provided in source documentation.
* **Dependencies:** 
  - Microsoft Defender Antivirus must be the primary antivirus and not in passive mode. [^4]
  - Real-time protection must be on. [^4]
  - Cloud-Delivery Protection must be on. [^4]
  - You must have Cloud Protection network connectivity. [^4]

## Implementation Steps

### Enable ASR rule to block Office apps from injecting code into other processes

1. Open Graph Explorer and authenticate. [^4]
2. Create a POST request to the Attack Surface Reduction policy endpoint:
   https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/templates/0e237410-1367-4844-bd7f-15fb0f08943b/createInstance. [^4]
3. Copy the JSON in the ACSC Attack Surface Reduction policy and paste it in the request body. Use the policy JSON at:
   [ACSC Windows Hardening Guidelines-Attack Surface Reduction.json](https://github.com/microsoft/Intune-ACSC-Windows-Hardening-Guidelines/blob/main/policies/ACSC%20Windows%20Hardening%20Guidelines-Attack%20Surface%20Reduction.json). [^1]
4. (Optional) modify the name value if necessary. [^4]
5. The imported ASR policy includes the rule to block Office injecting code into other processes. The rule is identified by GUID 75668C1F-73B5-4CF0-BB93-3ECF5CB7CC84. [^4]
6. Test in audit mode before enforcement. This helps assess impact and compatibility with line-of-business apps. [^2]
