## Summary

Create a Conditional Access policy requiring MFA for all privileged accounts.[^1][^2] MFA enforcement for administrators reduces credential theft risk and aligns with guidance to require MFA for privileged users and administrators.[^4][^5] Consider excluding emergency break-glass accounts from the policy or applying separate controls as described in the CA guidance.[^1]

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Implement a Conditional Access policy requiring MFA for all privileged accounts to enforce MFA for all administrative sign-ins.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 or an equivalent product. [^1]
* **Permissions/Roles:** Enforce MFA for privileged accounts via Conditional Access; use Privileged Identity Management for Just-In-Time access; limit the number of Global Administrators to fewer than five; define at least two emergency access accounts; use groups for role assignments; prefer passwordless MFA for admin accounts. [^1][^3][^4]
* **Dependencies:** Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) with Conditional Access and MFA support; Privileged Identity Management enabled. [^1][^4]
