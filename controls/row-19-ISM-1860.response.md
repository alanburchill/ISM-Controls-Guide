## Summary

PDF software is hardened using ASD and vendor hardening guidance, with the most restrictive guidance taking precedence when conflicts occur. Implementation requires applying vendor PDF hardening settings via Intune configuration profiles. This aligns with the Essential Eight user application hardening guidance documented by Microsoft Learn.

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Deploy vendor PDF hardening settings via Intune configuration profiles to enforce ASD and vendor hardening guidance, with the most restrictive settings taking precedence when conflicts occur.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Not provided in source documentation. [^1]

* **Permissions/Roles:** Access to Defender portal requires membership in the Security Reader AD built-in role to access Defender portal and Defender Vulnerability Management (DVM) features. [^1]

## Implementation Steps

### PDF hardening via Intune Attack Surface Reduction

1. In Intune, navigate to Endpoint Security > Attack Surface Reduction.
2. Create (or modify) an Attack Surface Reduction Endpoint Security Policy.
3. Set Block Adobe Reader from creating child processes to Enable.[^1]
4. Assign the Attack Surface Reduction Rule policy to a group.
Note: This ASR policy configures each of the ASR rules recommended by the ACSC in audit mode.[^1]
