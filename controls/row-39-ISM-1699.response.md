## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, then use the portal path Exposure management > Vulnerability management > Vulnerabilities to monitor vulnerabilities. This design aligns with the ImplementationGuidance by centralizing vulnerability visibility and remediation focus.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Not provided in source documentation. [^1]
* **Permissions/Roles:** Not provided in source documentation. [^2]
* **Dependencies:** Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. [^3]

## Implementation Steps

### Onboard devices and access vulnerability data in Defender portal

1. Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.  
   This onboarding step is implied by Defender Vulnerability Management capabilities for onboarded devices. See Defender Vulnerability Management documentation for context on onboarded devices being assessed.[^3]

2. In the Microsoft Defender portal, open Exposure management > Vulnerability management > Vulnerabilities to view the CVEs and affected devices.[^5]

3. Use the device group filter to tailor the vulnerability view across device groups. This filter applies throughout the vulnerability management pages.[^1]

4. Review the Vulnerabilities list to identify exposed devices and related CVEs. You can see details such as the CVE, severity, and affected software.[^5]

5. For a specific CVE, open the vulnerability details to review remediation options and security recommendations.[^3][^5]

6. When remediation is available, use the security recommendations prioritized to reduce exposure to implement fixes. The exposure score and recommendations help prioritize actions.[^2]

7. Monitor remediation progress and status across the dashboard, including top remediation activities and exposed devices, to gauge risk reduction over time.[^1]

8. (Optional) Review related software and exposure metrics (e.g., Top vulnerable software, Exposed devices) to support ongoing risk management.[^1]
