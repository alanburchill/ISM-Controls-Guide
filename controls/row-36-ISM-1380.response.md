## Summary

Deploy a Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policy to block cloud administrator sign-ins unless they originate from a trusted known IP address range.[^1] Plan the deployment by defining known locations, including pilot testing and staged rollout, and configure the policy to block access by default with optional MFA or session controls as needed.[^1] This approach enforces a least-privilege boundary at sign-in time and helps isolate privileged administration from untrusted networks, supporting controlled privileged environments.[^1]

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Deploy a Conditional Access policy that blocks cloud administrators unless they sign in from trusted IP address ranges. Use named locations to define the allowed networks, exclude emergency access accounts, and run a pilot before organization-wide rollout.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Not provided in source documentation. [^1]
* **Permissions/Roles:** Not provided in source documentation. [^1]
* **Dependencies:** Communicate change to users about the upcoming Conditional Access deployment and policy changes. [^1]

## Implementation Steps

### IP-based Conditional Access policy for cloud administrator access

1. Identify a trusted IP address range for admin sign-ins. Document the range and rationale. [^1]

2. Create a named location in Microsoft Entra ID for the trusted IP range. This named location will be used in the policy location condition. [^1]

3. Create a Conditional Access policy to block cloud administrators unless sign-in originates from the trusted IP range:

- Include: Directory roles -> Global Administrator; Privileged Role Administrator. [^1]

- Cloud apps: All cloud apps. [^1]

- Conditions: Location -> Include all locations; Exclude: the named location for trusted IPs. Result: block access when location is not the trusted IP. [^1]

- Grant: Block access. [^1]

4. Exclude emergency access/break-glass accounts from this policy during rollout to avoid inadvertent lockout. [^1]

5. Test policies with a pilot group before organization-wide rollout; verify logging and impact. [^1]

6. Deploy in phases; monitor sign-in activity, adjust as needed. [^1]

7. Reference IP-based restrictions guidance in other sources as needed. For example, see SWIFT Alliance Cloud on Azure for IP-restriction discussion. [^4]
