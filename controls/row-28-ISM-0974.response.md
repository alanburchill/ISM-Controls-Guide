## Summary

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for standard user sign-ins.[^2] Enforce MFA for all users by implementing a Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access policy that requires MFA for all users (no app exclusions); use built-in templates or baseline policies as guidance to configure the policy.[^1]

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Enforce multifactor authentication for all standard users via a Conditional Access policy to satisfy the ImplementationGuidance requirement.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license is required to implement Conditional Access policies. If Conditional Access cannot be used, security defaults can be enabled instead. [^2][^4]
* **Permissions/Roles:** Must have appropriate permissions assigned to perform MFA configuration. To create Conditional Access policies, sign in as at least a Conditional Access Administrator. [^1][^2]
* **Dependencies:** Access to the Microsoft Entra admin center is required. Conditional Access deployment requires a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license. [^2]

## Implementation Steps

### Baseline policy: Require MFA for all users via Conditional Access

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center as at least a Conditional Access Administrator.[^2]
2. Browse to Entra ID > Conditional Access > Policies.[^2]
3. Select New policy.[^2]
4. Give your policy a meaningful name. You may customize the policy name.[^2]
5. Under Assignments, select Users or workload identities.
   - Include: All users
   - Exclude: Users and groups (choose emergency access or break-glass accounts). If using directory synchronization, consider excluding Directory roles and Directory Synchronization Accounts.[^2]
6. Under Target resources > Resources (formerly cloud apps) > Include, select All resources (formerly All cloud apps).[^2]
7. Under Access controls > Grant, select Grant access.
   - Select Require authentication strength, then select the built-in Multifactor authentication strength. Click Select.[^2]
8. Confirm your settings and set Enable policy to Report-only. Then choose Create.[^2]
9. After creation, review using policy impact or report-only mode, and move Enable policy from Report-only to On to enforce MFA.[^2]
