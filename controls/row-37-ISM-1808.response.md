## Summary

Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to enable Defender Vulnerability Management (DVM) and continuous risk monitoring.[^1] In the Microsoft Defender portal, navigate to Exposure management > Vulnerability management > Vulnerabilities to view CVEs, weaknesses, and device exposure.[^2] Use the remediation workflow to create remediation tasks in Intune and apply fixes per security recommendations.[^1]

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, then use the "Microsoft Defender" security portal report under "Exposure management" > "Vulnerabilities" to identify, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities across devices.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (DVM) standalone offering, or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 or E5 license; full capabilities of DVM are available as an add-on. [^1]
* **Permissions/Roles:** Must be in the Security Reader AD built-in role to access the Defender portal. [^1]
* **Dependencies:**
  - Onboard devices to Defender for Endpoint; if not onboarded, Defender for Endpoint must be running in block mode (passive). [^1]
  - The Defender portal is accessible via Microsoft Edge (recommended) or Google Chrome; ensure browser compatibility. [^1]

## Implementation Steps

### Onboard devices to Defender for Endpoint

1. Determine onboarding status for each device:
   - If a device is already onboarded to Defender for Endpoint, Defender Vulnerability Management (DVM) features are enabled and available in the Microsoft Defender portal. 
   - If a device is not onboarded, DVM requires Defender for Endpoint to be running in block mode (passive).  
   [^1]

2. Onboard devices to Defender for Endpoint:
   - Use supported onboarding methods such as Group Policy, Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune), or local scripts. 
   - Refer to guidance for onboarding: Onboard devices and configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint capabilities.  
   [^1]

3. After onboarding, ensure Defender Vulnerability Management features are enabled in the Defender portal.  
   [^1]

4. Access the Defender portal:
   - Open the Microsoft Defender portal (Edge or Chrome recommended).
   - At minimum, be granted the Security Reader role to view exposure and vulnerability data.  
   [^3]

### Access vulnerability data in Defender portal

5. In the Defender portal, navigate to Exposure management > Vulnerability management > Vulnerabilities to view vulnerability data.  
   [^5]

6. Use the Vulnerability Management view to examine vulnerabilities, including CVEs, threats, and exposed devices. Open a specific vulnerability to see detailed information and associated devices.  
   [^5]

### Remediation workflow (optional)

7. If remediation is required, enable the Microsoft Intune connection in Defender portal:
   - In the Defender portal, go to Settings > Endpoints > General > Advanced features.
   - Turn on Microsoft Intune connection.  
   [^3]

8. In Vulnerability management, select a security recommendation and choose Remediation options. Complete the form with:
   - What you are requesting remediation for, applicable device groups, priority, due date, and optional notes.  
   - Submitting creates a remediation activity in Vulnerability Management and a remediation task in Intune.  
   [^3]

9. The Intune admin reviews the security task, accepts it, and remediates per the guidance provided. Remediation guidance may include links to relevant Intune configurations.
