## Summary

Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to enable vulnerability monitoring and management[^1]. In the Microsoft Defender security portal, navigate to Exposure management > Vulnerabilities to view and prioritize vulnerabilities across endpoints[^3]. Defender Vulnerability Management provides asset visibility, vulnerability assessments, and remediation workflows, including remediation tasks that can be created in Intune to address identified weaknesses[^3].

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Then use the security portal's Exposure management > Vulnerabilities report to identify and monitor unmitigated vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (DVM) licensing is available as a standalone offering, or as part of Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 or E5 license. Full capabilities require the DVM add-on. [^2]

* **Permissions/Roles:** Access to the Microsoft Defender portal and DVM requires membership in the Security Reader AD built-in role. [^1]

* **Dependencies:** 
  - Devices must be onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint; if already onboarded (with a P2 license), DVM features are enabled. [^1]
  - For devices not onboarded to Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Endpoint must be running in block mode (passive) to enable DVM. [^1]

## Implementation Steps

### Onboard devices to Defender for Endpoint

1. Create a Windows Configuration Profile with a type of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. [^4]
2. Set Expedite telemetry reporting frequency to Enable. [^4]
3. Assign the profile to a group containing all applicable Windows devices. [^4]
4. For more information, see Onboard devices and configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint capabilities. [Onboard devices and configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint capabilities.](/en-us/defender-endpoint/onboard-configure) [^4]

### Access Defender vulnerability report

5. In the Microsoft Defender portal, navigate to Exposure management > Vulnerabilities to view vulnerability data. Note that the Vulnerability Management section is now located under Exposure management. [^3] [^4]
