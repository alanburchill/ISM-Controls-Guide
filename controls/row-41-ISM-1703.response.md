## Summary

Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and enable Defender Vulnerability Management to continuously monitor risk across your devices.[^1][^2] Then use the Microsoft Defender security portal, under Exposure management > Vulnerabilities, to view identified vulnerabilities and surface remediation actions.[^4] Remediation tasks can be tracked within Defender Vulnerability Management and, where applicable, surfaced as Intune security tasks for remediation.[^3][^4]

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Onboard devices to Defender for Endpoint and then use the Microsoft Defender security portal's Exposure management > Vulnerabilities report to identify and track vulnerabilities in drivers.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (DVM), a standalone offering provides the complete set of vulnerability tools and capabilities; or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 or E5 license provides subset of core vulnerability management capabilities. [^1]
* **Permissions/Roles:** Access to the Microsoft Defender portal requires membership in the Security Reader AD built-in role to access Defender Vulnerability Management. [^1]
* **Dependencies:** Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. [^3] Onboard devices to Defender Vulnerability Management. [^2]

## Implementation Steps

### Onboard devices to Defender for Endpoint and Defender Vulnerability Management

1. Onboard endpoints to Defender for Endpoint:
   1. Create a new Windows Configuration Profile with a type of Template > Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (desktop devices running Windows 10 or later).[^1]
   2. Set Expedite telemetry reporting frequency to Enable.[^1]
   3. Assign the profile to a group containing all applicable Windows devices.[^1]
2. Onboard devices to Defender Vulnerability Management (DVM):
   1. In the Defender portal, open the Onboarding section. Choose the operating system for the devices you wish to onboard and select the Deployment method you plan to use, then follow the instructions to onboard your devices.[^2]
   2. Complete onboarding as directed by the on-screen guidance.[^2]
3. Access vulnerability reports:
   1. Open the Microsoft Defender Security portal.[^3]
   2. Navigate to Exposure management > Vulnerabilities to view the Microsoft Defender security portal report.[^3]
