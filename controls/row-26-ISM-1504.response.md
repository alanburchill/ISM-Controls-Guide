## Summary

Require MFA for all users accessing sensitive online services through Conditional Access. Deploy a policy covering All users and All resources that enforces MFA via the built-in authentication strengths (including phishing-resistant MFA where applicable). Exclude emergency access/break-glass accounts and validate the policy in report-only mode before turning it on.

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Require MFA for all users accessing sensitive online services via Conditional Access to enforce the policy per ImplementationGuidance.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Risk-based policies require Microsoft Entra ID P2 licenses. [^3]
* **Permissions/Roles:** Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center as at least a Conditional Access Administrator. [^1]
* **Dependencies:** Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) with Conditional Access capabilities. [^2]

## Implementation Steps

### Require MFA for all users via Conditional Access

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center as at least a Conditional Access Administrator.  
2. Navigate to Entra ID > Conditional Access > Policies.  
3. Select New policy.  
4. Give your policy a meaningful name.  
5. Under Assignments, select Users or workload identities.  
   1. Under Include, select All users.  
   2. Under Exclude,  
      - Select Users and groups and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts.  
      - If you use hybrid identity solutions like Microsoft Entra Connect or Microsoft Entra Connect Cloud Sync, select Directory roles, then Directory Synchronization Accounts.  
6. Under Target resources > Resources (formerly cloud apps) > Include, select All resources (formerly 'All cloud apps').  
7. Under Access controls > Grant, select Grant access.  
   1. Select Require authentication strength, then select the built-in Multifactor authentication strength from the list.  
   2. Select Save.  
8. Confirm your settings and set Enable policy to Report-only.  
9. Select Create to create to enable your policy.  
10. After confirming your settings using policy impact or report-only mode, move the Enable policy toggle from Report-only to On.
