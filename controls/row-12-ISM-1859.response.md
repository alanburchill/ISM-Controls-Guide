## Summary

Office productivity suites are hardened using ASD and vendor hardening guidance, with the most restrictive guidance taking precedence when conflicts occur.[^2]

Apply ACSC Office hardening policies via Intune configuration profiles to implement macro protections, ASR rules, and Defender for Endpoint integration for Office macro activity.[^1]

Intune supports policy sets to bundle Microsoft 365 Apps and ACSC hardening guidelines for streamlined deployment.[^1]

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Apply ACSC Office hardening policies via Intune configuration profiles to centrally enforce hardened Office settings across all managed Windows devices.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Not provided in source documentation.
* **Permissions/Roles:** Intune administrator privileges required to create/import configuration policies, create policy sets, and assign to groups; ability to create and manage the group "All Office Users" used in deployment. [^1]
* **Dependencies:** 
  - ACSC policy and script files required for deployment:
    - ACSC Office Hardening Guidelines policy JSON
    - ACSC Windows Hardening Guidelines – Attack Surface Reduction policy JSON
    - Macros Enabled for Trusted Publishers.json
    - All Macros Disabled.json
    - OfficeMacroHardening-PreventActivationofOLE.ps1
  - Access to the Microsoft Intune console to import policies and create policy sets. [^1]
  - Access to Graph Explorer to create ASR policy instances. [^1]
  - Defender for Endpoint onboarding via Intune (MDE) for logging macro executions. [^2]
  - Windows 10 or later devices enrolled in Intune with Defender for Endpoint integration. [^2]

## Implementation Steps

### Deploy ACSC Office Hardening via Intune Policy Set[^1]

1. Stage 1: To create the policy to target desired users
   1. Create a policy to be used to contain users that are targeted with the Office apps and the Office hardening policies. This group is referred to as All Office Users.
   2. Create the Microsoft 365 Apps for Windows 10 or later app, under **Apps > Windows > Add > Microsoft 365 Apps**.
   3. Include the Microsoft 365 Apps as required by your organization.
   4. Set the architecture to: **64-bit** (recommended).
   5. Set the Update Channel to: **Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel** (recommended).
   - Note: Don't assign the application. This is done in a later step.

2. Stage 2: To import the ACSC hardening guideline policy
   1. Save the ACSC Office Hardening Guidelines policy to your local device.
      - Policy file: [ACSC Office Hardening Guidelines.json](https://github.com/microsoft/Intune-ACSC-Windows-Hardening-Guidelines/blob/main/office/policies/ACSC%20Office%20Hardening%20Guidelines.json)
   2. Navigate to the Microsoft Intune console: https://aka.ms/in.
   3. Import a policy, under **Devices > Windows > Configuration profiles > Create** > **Import Policy**.
   4. Name the policy, select Browse for files under Policy file and navigate to the saved policy from step 1.
   5. Select **Save**.
   6. Import script to prevent activation of Object Linking and Embedding packages
      - Script: [OfficeMacroHardening-PreventActivationofOLE.ps1](https://github.com/microsoft/Intune-ACSC-Windows-Hardening-Guidelines/blob/main/office/scripts/OfficeMacroHardening-PreventActivationofOLE.ps1)
   7. Run this script using the logged on credentials: **Yes**.
   8. Enforce script signature check: **No**.
   9. Run script in 64-bit PowerShell Host: **No**.
   10. Assign the PowerShell script to: **All Office Users** (created in Stage 1).
   - Note: The script content is provided remotely via the linked resource.

3. Stage 3: Creation of the policy set combining Microsoft 365 Apps and ACSC Hardening Guideline policy
   1. Navigate to **Devices > Policy sets > Create**.
   2. Under **Application Management > Apps**, select **Microsoft 365 Apps (for Windows 10 and later)** (created in Stage 1).
   3. Under **Device Management > Device Configuration Profiles**, select **ACSC Office Hardening** (created in Stage 2).
   4. Under **Assignments** select **All Office Users** (created in Stage 1).
   5. Import the Endpoint Security Attack Surface Reduction policy.
      - ASR policy JSON: [ACSC Windows Hardening Guidelines-Attack Surface Reduction.json](https://github.com/microsoft/Intune-ACSC-Windows-Hardening-Guidelines/blob/main/policies/ACSC%20Windows%20Hardening%20Guidelines-Attack%20Surface%20Reduction.json)
   6. Navigate to Graph Explorer and authenticate.
   7. Create a POST request, using the beta schema to the Attack Surface Reduction policy endpoint: https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/templates/0e237410-1367-4844-bd7f-15fb0f08943b/createInstance
   8. Copy the JSON in the [ACSC Windows Hardening Guidelines-Attack Surface Reduction policy](https://github.com/microsoft/Intune-ACSC-Windows-Hardening-Guidelines/blob/main/policies/ACSC%20Windows%20Hardening%20Guidelines-Attack%20Surface%20Reduction.json) and paste it in the request body.
   9. (Optional) modify the name value if necessary.
   10. Assign the policy to: **All Office Users** (created in Stage 1).

Note: This Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) policy configures each of the ASR rules recommended by the ACSC in audit mode. ASR rules should be tested for compatibility issues in any environment before enforcement.
