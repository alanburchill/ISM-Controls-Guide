## Summary

Microsoft Office is configured to prevent activation of OLE packages. Deploy the Intune PowerShell script OfficeMacroHardening-PreventActivationofOLE.ps1 to import registry keys that block OLE/COM activation in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, and assign the script to a deployment group. Configure the script to run with the logged-on credentials, not require script signing, and not run in a 64-bit PowerShell host. [^1]

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Deploy the OfficeMacroHardening-PreventActivationofOLE.ps1 PowerShell script via Intune to block activation of OLE packages in Office (Excel, PowerPoint, Word).

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Not provided in source documentation.

* **Permissions/Roles:** 
  - Run this script using the logged on credentials: Yes.[^1]
  - Assign the script to a deployment group.[^1]

* **Dependencies:** 
  - OfficeMacroHardening-PreventActivationofOLE.ps1 is required. [OfficeMacroHardening-PreventActivationofOLE.ps1](https://github.com/microsoft/Intune-ACSC-Windows-Hardening-Guidelines/blob/main/office/scripts/OfficeMacroHardening-PreventActivationofOLE.ps1)[^1]
  - Script options: Run this script using the logged on credentials: Yes; Enforce script signature check: No; Run script in 64-bit PowerShell Host: No.[^1]
  - The script is unsigned. If script signing is required, sign the script and change Enforce script signature check to Yes.[^1]

## Implementation Steps

### Microsoft Office is configured to prevent activation of OLE packages

1. Add [OfficeMacroHardening-PreventActivationofOLE.ps1](https://github.com/microsoft/Intune-ACSC-Windows-Hardening-Guidelines/blob/main/office/scripts/OfficeMacroHardening-PreventActivationofOLE.ps1) as a PowerShell script with the following options:
   - Run this script using the logged on credentials: **Yes**
   - Enforce script signature check: **No**
   - Run script in 64-bit PowerShell Host: **No**  
   [^1]

2. Assign the script to a deployment group.  
   [^1]

3. The script is unsigned. If you have required script signing, review the following documentation to sign the script so that it can be executed on your Windows devices: [Methods of signing scripts](/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_signing) and change the *Enforce script signature check* to: Yes.
