## Summary

Remote Credential Guard functionality is enabled to protect credentials over an RDP connection.[^1] Enable Remote Credential Guard on devices via Intune Settings Catalog policy or a custom Policy CSP, per Microsoft Learn guidance.[^1][^2]

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Enable Remote Credential Guard using an Intune custom configuration policy to enforce credential protection for RDP sessions.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Supported Windows editions for Remote Credential Guard are Windows Pro, Windows Enterprise, Windows Pro Education/SE, and Windows Education. RC Guard license entitlements are granted by Windows Pro/Pro Education/SE, Windows Enterprise, and Windows Education licenses. [^1]

* **Permissions/Roles:** Client and remote host must be joined to an Active Directory domain; RC Guard can be used only with AD-joined devices. The user must be authorized to connect via Remote Desktop to the remote host (e.g., member of the Remote Desktop Users local group on the remote host). The client must run the Remote Desktop Windows application (the UWP version does not support Remote Credential Guard). The client must use Kerberos authentication; NTLM fallback is not allowed for RC Guard. [^1]

* **Dependencies:** Intune/MDM is required to configure Remote Credential Guard via policy. Deploy via Settings Catalog policies to:
  - Enable delegation of nonexportable credentials on remote hosts:
    - Category: Administrative Templates > System > Credentials Delegation
    - Setting: Remote host allows delegation of nonexportable credentials
    - Value: Enabled
    - OMA-URI: `./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/CredentialsDelegation/RemoteHostAllowsDelegationOfNonExportableCredentials`
    - Data type: string
    - Value: `<enabled/>`
  - Restrict credential delegation on clients:
    - Category: Administrative Templates > System > Credentials Delegation
    - Setting: Restrict delegation of credentials to remote servers
    - Value: Enabled
    - OMA-URI: `./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/ADMX_CredSsp/RestrictedRemoteAdministration`
    - Data type: string
    - Value: `<enabled/>` (Possible values: 0: Disabled, 1: Require Restricted Admin, 2: Require Remote Credential Guard, 3: Restrict credential delegation)
  Deployments are performed via Intune Settings Catalog or equivalent policy mechanisms. [^1]

## Implementation Steps

### Enable Remote Credential Guard using Intune custom configuration

1. In Intune, create a Settings Catalog policy. Use the policy path referenced in the source to locate the relevant settings. [^1]

2. Configure the policy setting:
   - Category: Administrative Templates > System > Credentials Delegation
   - Setting name: Remote host allows delegation of nonexportable credentials
   - Value: Enabled

   Assign the policy to a group that contains the devices or users to configure. [^1]

3. Alternatively, create a custom policy using the Policy CSP:
   - OMA-URI: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/CredentialsDelegation/RemoteHostAllowsDelegationOfNonExportableCredentials
   - Data type: string
   - Value: <enabled/>
   
   Assign the policy to the target group. [^1]

4. Validate Intune policy deployment on target devices and verify Remote Credential Guard behavior during RDP sessions. If Intune-based configuration is not feasible, use an per-session approach as a fallback. 
   - mstsc.exe /remoteGuard (per-session) [^1]

5. Access the remote host using Remote Desktop with Remote Credential Guard enabled to protect credentials over RDP. [^1]
