## Summary

Credentials for break-glass emergency accounts are long, unique, unpredictable and managed. Configure the break-glass accounts with randomly generated passwords and a physical FIDO2 key for MFA. Implement dual-control retrieval procedures and monitoring to detect and respond to emergency access events.

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Break-glass emergency access accounts are cloud-only Global Administrator accounts with randomly generated passwords and hardware-based MFA using a physical FIDO2 key. Two such accounts are provisioned; credentials are rotated and monitored per the emergency access procedures.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management is included in Microsoft Entra ID P2 or EMS E5. [^2]

* **Permissions/Roles:** Define at least two emergency access (break-glass) accounts with the Global Administrator role; accounts must be cloud-only; the first user to configure PIM should be assigned to Security Administrator and Privileged Role Administrator roles; MFA must be enabled for privileged accounts. [^3][^2]

* **Dependencies:** Microsoft Entra ID serves as the centralized identity platform; use Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to enable just-in-time privileged access; ensure availability of break-glass accounts and, optionally, FIDO2 passkeys for break-glass authentication. [^4][^1]

## Implementation Steps

### Set up emergency access

1. Create emergency access accounts: Configure at least two cloud-only accounts with the Global Administrator role in Microsoft Entra ID. Use descriptive names that clearly identify their purpose. Ensure accounts are not assigned to specific individuals and remain dedicated exclusively for emergency scenarios.[^1]

2. Secure credentials with dual control: Generate strong, randomly generated passwords of at least 32 characters configured to never expire. Split credentials into multiple parts and store them in separate secure physical locations. Document retrieval procedures requiring multi-person approval.[^1]

3. Configure Conditional Access exclusions and MFA: Exclude at least one emergency account from all Conditional Access policies and MFA requirements to guarantee access during service disruptions. Optionally secure the second account with FIDO2 security keys stored in secure locations.[^1]

4. Enable comprehensive monitoring and alerting: Configure monitoring (Azure Monitor or Microsoft Sentinel) to analyze Microsoft Entra ID sign-in and audit logs. Create real-time alerts (email and SMS) for emergency account authentication or configuration changes. Establish incident response procedures requiring immediate security team notification and justification documentation for all emergency account usage.[^1]

5. Establish testing and maintenance procedures: Test emergency account access quarterly to verify functionality. Update credentials every 90 days or immediately after personnel changes affecting authorized users. Train authorized administrators on break-glass procedures, including credential retrieval and incident documentation. Maintain written runbooks detailing the complete emergency access process for compliance and readiness.[^1]
