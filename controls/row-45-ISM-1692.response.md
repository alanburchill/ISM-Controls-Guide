## Summary

Patches, updates or other vendor mitigations for vulnerabilities in office productivity suites, web browsers and their extensions, email clients, PDF software, and security products are applied within 48 hours of release when vulnerabilities are critical or exploits exist. Configure and enable Windows Autopatch for all workstations via the InTune admin portal, and deploy third-party application updates through the Intune Enterprise Application Catalog; otherwise repackage and redeploy apps with security updates within the required timeline. For the Edge browser, Autopatch configures devices to the Stable channel by default, and Edge update policies are created and verified within Autopatch groups. Defender Vulnerability Management identifies vulnerabilities and can trigger remediation tasks in Intune to close patching gaps.

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Enable Windows Autopatch for all workstations via the InTune admin portal. Deploy third-party application updates through the Enterprise Application Catalogue, or repackage and redeploy all updates within the required timeline. Configure the Edge browser to "Targe Channel" or "Stable" to ensure timely security updates.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Windows Autopatch features require Business Premium, A3+, E3+, or F3 licenses. [^1]
* **Permissions/Roles:** Access to the Microsoft Intune admin center is required. [^1]
* **Dependencies:**
  - Configured and enable Windows Autopatch for all workstations via the Intune admin portal. [^1]
  - For third-party applications deploy new version of the application via Intune Enterprise Application Catalogue. [^2]
  - Edge browser configured to Target Channel or Stable. [^3]

## Implementation Steps

### Edge updates via Windows Autopatch

Windows Autopatch uses the Stable Channel of Microsoft Edge. Configure Edge updates through Windows Autopatch in Intune as follows.

1. Go to the Microsoft Intune admin center.[^3]
2. Navigate to Tenant Administration > Windows Autopatch > Autopatch groups.[^3]
3. Select an Autopatch group to modify (repeat these steps for each group).[^3]
4. Next to Update types, select Edit.[^3]
5. Select Microsoft Edge updates.[^3]
6. Select Next: Deployment settings > Next: Release schedules > Next: Review + save > Save to save these changes.[^3]
7. We recommend deleting old Autopatch default policies to avoid policy conflict. Navigate to Devices > Manage devices > Configuration > Policies tab.[^3]
8. The following profiles should be removed from your list of profiles and no longer visible/active. Use the Search with the keywords "Microsoft Edge Update Channel". The result should return 0 profiles filtered.
   - Windows Autopatch - Edge Update Channel Beta
   - Windows Autopatch - Edge Update Channel Stable[^3]

### Turn off Microsoft Edge updates

1. Go to the Microsoft Intune admin center.[^3]
2. Navigate to Tenant Administration > Windows Autopatch > Autopatch groups.[^3]
3. Select an Autopatch group to modify (repeat these steps for each group).[^3]
4. Next to Update types, select Edit.[^3]
5. Unselect Microsoft Edge updates.[^3]
6. Next: Deployment settings > Next: Release schedules > Next: Review + save > Save to save these changes.[^3]

### Verify Microsoft Edge updates policies

1. Go to the Microsoft Intune admin center.[^3]
2. Navigate to Tenant Administration > Windows Autopatch > Autopatch groups.[^3]
3. Verify each Autopatch group has the Microsoft Edge Update Type checkbox selected.[^3]
4. Navigate to Devices > Manage devices > Configuration > Policies.[^3]
5. The following new policies should be discoverable from the list of profiles:
   - "Windows Autopatch Microsoft Edge Update Policy - <group name> - <ring name>"
6. The following profiles should be removed from your list of profiles and no longer visible/active. Use the Search with the keywords "Microsoft Edge Update Channel". The result should return 0 profiles filtered. 
   - Windows Autopatch - Edge Update Channel Beta
   - Windows Autopatch - Edge Update Channel Stable[^3]

### Verify Microsoft Edge updates policies are created

1. Go to the Microsoft Intune admin center.[^3]
2. Navigate to Devices > Manage devices > Configuration > Policies.[^3]
3. Confirm the new policies are named: "Windows Autopatch Microsoft Edge Update Policy - <group name> - <ring name>"[^3]

### Update release schedule

Microsoft Edge checks for updates every 10 hours. Quality updates occur weekly by default. The Microsoft Edge product group progressively rolls out feature updates automatically every four weeks to ensure the best experience for customers. The update is available within a few days of the initial release. Devices in the Test device group receive feature updates from the Beta Channel. This channel is fully supported and automatically updated with new features approximately every four weeks.[^3]
