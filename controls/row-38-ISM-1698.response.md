## Summary

Daily vulnerability scanning identifies missing patches or vulnerabilities for online services[^2]. Monitor the Microsoft 365 Admin Portal Service Health to watch for announcements of service vulnerabilities and advisories[^1].

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Monitor the Microsoft 365 Admin Portal Service Health page to detect and track service vulnerability announcements affecting the tenant.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Not provided in source documentation.
* **Permissions/Roles:** Service health view requires admin roles such as Service Support admin or Helpdesk admin. For Lighthouse, at least one Microsoft Entra role with property set microsoft.office365.serviceHealth/allEntities/allTasks. [^1][^3]
* **Dependencies:** Access to the Microsoft 365 admin center with an admin account to sign in. [^1]

## Implementation Steps

### Monitor Microsoft 365 Service Health for vulnerability announcements

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center at [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com) and authenticate with an admin account. [^1]

2. To view service health, in the left-hand navigation, go to **Health** > **Service health**, or select the **Service health** card on the **Home** dashboard. The dashboard card indicates whether there's an active service issue and links to the detailed **Service health** page. [^1]

3. On the **Service health** page, the health state of each cloud service is shown in a table format. The **Overview** tab shows all services, their current health state, and any active incidents or advisories; the **Issue history** tab shows past incidents. [^1]

4. If you're experiencing an issue and you don't see it listed, select **Report an issue**, and complete the short form. We'll review related data and reports from other organizations to determine if the issue is widespread or originates from the service; if so, it will be added as a new incident or advisory on the **Service health** page. The **Reported issues** tab shows issues your tenant has reported and their status. [^1]

5. To customize your view of which services show up on the dashboard, select **Customize > Custom view**, and clear the checkboxes for the services you want to filter out of your Service health dashboard view. Make sure that the checkbox is selected for each service that you want to monitor. [^1]

6. To sign up for email notifications of new incidents that affect your tenant and status changes for an active incident, select **Customize > Email**, select **Send me email notifications about service health**, and then specify:
   - Up to two email addresses
   - Whether you want notifications for incidents or advisories
   - The services for which you want notification
   Note: Each admin can have their Preferences set and the above limit of two email addresses is per admin account. [^1]

7. View details of posted service health issue:
   - In the **Active issues Microsoft is working on** section, select the issue title to see the issue detail page.
   - The advisory or incident summary provides information such as Title, ID, Last updated, Estimated start time, Affected services, Issue type, Status, User Impact, and All Updates. [^1]
