## Summary

Lock PDF security settings using Intune so users cannot change them.[^1] Policies deployed via Intune enforce these configurations, ensuring end users cannot modify PDF security settings.[^1]

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Lock PDF security settings using Intune so users cannot change them.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Not provided in source documentation.

* **Permissions/Roles:** Not provided in source documentation.

* **Dependencies:** Intune must be used to deploy the security baseline policies and scripts referenced for this control (OfficeMacroHardening-PreventActivationofOLE.ps1, UserApplicationHardening-RemoveFeatures.ps1) and to enforce Edge Baseline and Attack Surface Reduction policies; tamper protection must be enabled on endpoints (Windows 10/11) to prevent changes to security settings; endpoints must be onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint as needed. Intune can onboard devices to Defender for Endpoint. [^1][^2][^3]

[^3]:[Protect security settings with tamper protection - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection)

## Implementation Steps

### PDF software is blocked from creating child processes

1. In Intune, navigate to Endpoint Security > Attack Surface Reduction.
2. Create (or modify) a new Attack Surface Reduction Endpoint Security Policy.
3. Set Block Adobe Reader from creating child processes to Enable.
4. Assign the policy to a deployment group.

> [!NOTE] When policies deployed via Intune are in effect, the settings contained are enforced and cannot be changed by standard users. [^1]
