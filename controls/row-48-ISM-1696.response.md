## Summary

Push critical OS patches within 48 hours using Intune expedited updates with Windows Autopatch. Expedited quality updates via Intune accelerate installation of the latest security updates and require Windows Autopatch licensing to enable the workflow[^1][^3]. Windows Autopatch provides governance for patch deployment, including approval/scheduling, gradual rollout, and expedited updates across OS, drivers, and firmware, with deployment rings to tailor coverage[^4].

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Design decision: Push critical OS patches within 48 hours using Intune expedited updates via Windows Autopatch. This leverages expedited updates to rapidly remediate critical vulnerabilities on workstations and non-internet-facing devices.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** An Intune license is required. A Windows Autopatch license is required. Acceptable Windows Autopatch subscriptions include Windows Enterprise E3 or E5; Windows Education A3 or A5; Windows Virtual Desktop Access E3 or E5; Microsoft 365 Business Premium. [^3]

* **Permissions/Roles:** Global Administrator role is required to run the readiness assessment. Admin contacts must be configured for Windows Autopatch with focus areas. [^3]

* **Dependencies:** 
  - Supported Windows versions remain in support for servicing (x86/x64). [^3]
  - Supported Windows editions include Windows 10/11 Pro, Enterprise, Education, Pro Education, Pro for Workstations. [^3]
  - Devices must be enrolled in Intune and be Microsoft Entra joined, or Entra hybrid joined. Workplace Join is not supported. [^3]
  - Devices must have access to endpoints and be configured to receive Quality Updates directly from Windows Update. [^3]
  - Update Health Tools must be installed (KB 4023057 or manual download). Note: Windows 11, version 24H2 and above cannot apply KB 4023057. [^3]

## Implementation Steps

### Windows Autopatch expedited OS patch deployment

1. Verify prerequisites. Ensure a Windows Autopatch license is in place and devices are enrolled in Intune. Devices must be joined to Microsoft Entra (or hybrid joined), have access to endpoints, and be configured to receive Quality Updates directly from the Windows Update service. Update Health Tools must be installed (KB 4023057 or equivalent) as applicable; note that Windows 11, version 24H2 and above cannot apply KB 4023057. These prerequisites are described for Autopatch usage and expedited updates[^3].

2. Sign in to the Microsoft Intune admin center.

3. Navigate to: Devices > Manage updates > Windows 10 and later updates > Quality updates tab > Create profile. Create the expedited quality update profile for your fleet[^3].

4. In Settings, configure Expedite installation of quality updates if device OS version is less than the selected update. Choose the update to expedite from the dropdown. The dropdown includes only updates eligible for expediting. This setting enables expedited deployment for the chosen quality update[^3].

5. In Settings, configure the Number of days to wait before forced reboot. Select 0, 1, or 2 days as appropriate for your organization. The reboot behavior adheres to the configured deadline for forced restarts[^3].

6. In Assignments, add groups containing all applicable Windows devices to receive the expedited update policy.

7. In Review + create, review the configuration and create the policy. After creation, monitor deployment status via Intune reports and the Windows Expedited Update resources:
   - Reports > Windows updates
   - Windows Expedited Update Report
   - Summary and device-specific views as needed[^3].

> Note: Expedited updates bypass standard update deferrals to accelerate critical security updates. Expedited updates are intended for urgent risk scenarios and are not recommended for routine monthly servicing; use Update Rings for standard cadence where appropriate[^3].
