## Summary

Configure Entra ID diagnostic settings to save all logs to an appropriate destination, such as a Log Analytics workspace.[^2]

Log Analytics provides centralized analysis of Entra ID activity logs once forwarding is configured.[^1]

Integrate Entra ID logs with Azure Monitor logs to enable unified querying and monitoring across Entra ID and other Azure data.[^3]

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Configure Entra ID diagnostic settings to route all relevant logs (SigninLogs and AuditLogs) to a Log Analytics workspace for centralized storage and accessible analysis.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** A Microsoft Entra tenant with a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license associated with it. [^1]
* **Permissions/Roles:**
  - Read access to Entra ID logs via built-in roles such as Reports Reader, Security Reader, Global Reader. [^1]
  - Update access to create and edit diagnostic settings to send Entra data to a Log Analytics workspace. [^1]
  - The appropriate roles for Azure Monitor and Microsoft Entra ID. [^1]
* **Dependencies:** A Log Analytics workspace and access to that workspace. [^1]

## Implementation Steps

### Configure Entra ID diagnostic settings to save logs to a Log Analytics workspace

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center as at least a Security Administrator.[^1]
2. Browse to Entra ID > Monitoring & health > Diagnostic settings.[^1]
3. Select Add diagnostic setting.[^1]
4. On the Diagnostic setting page, perform the following steps:
   1. Provide a name for the diagnostic setting.[^1]
   2. Under Logs, select AuditLogs and SigninLogs.[^1]
   3. Under Destination details, select Send to Log Analytics, and then select your new log analytics workspace.[^1]
   4. Select Save.[^1]
5. Your selected logs might take up to 15 minutes for the logs to populate in your Log Analytics workspace.[^1]
