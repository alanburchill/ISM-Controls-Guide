## Summary

Office hardening policies deployed via Intune enforce Office security settings and prevent standard users from altering them[^1]. Deploy the Intune Office security baseline to apply macro settings, Trust Center protections, and related Office configurations as part of policy delivery[^2]. These baselines provide a centralized, enforceable mechanism to ensure Office configurations remain fixed across managed devices[^3].

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Deploy Intune Office hardening policies to lock down security settings, preventing users from changing Office security configurations.

## Implementation Steps

### Deploy Microsoft 365 Apps security baseline for Office

1. In the Intune console, create a Security Baseline for the Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise security baseline. Use the version that corresponds to Office hardening (e.g., Version 2306).[^2]

2. Review the baseline content and ensure Office-related security settings enforce the required restrictions and cannot be changed by users. This includes settings related to Office macros and Trust Center hardening.[^2]

3. Assign the baseline to the target device group(s) and monitor deployment status.[^2]

### Deploy hardening scripts to lock Office settings

1. Deploy the OfficeMacroHardening-PreventActivationofOLE.ps1 script to import registry keys that block the activation of OLE packages in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. Use the script URL: [OfficeMacroHardening-PreventActivationofOLE.ps1](https://github.com/microsoft/Intune-ACSC-Windows-Hardening-Guidelines/blob/main/office/scripts/OfficeMacroHardening-PreventActivationofOLE.ps1). Run this script using the logged on credentials: **Yes**; Enforce script signature check: **No**; Run script in 64-bit PowerShell Host: **No**. Assign the script to a deployment group.[^1]

2. Deploy the UserApplicationHardening-RemoveFeatures.ps1 script to disable features such as Internet Explorer, .NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0), and Windows PowerShell 2.0, as described in the ACSC guidelines. Use the script URL: [UserApplicationHardening-RemoveFeatures.ps1](https://github.com/microsoft/Intune-ACSC-Windows-Hardening-Guidelines/blob/main/scripts/UserApplicationHardening-RemoveFeatures.ps1). Run this script using the logged on credentials: **No**; Enforce script signature check: **No**; Run script in 64-bit PowerShell Host: **No**. Assign the script to a deployment group.[^1]

Notes:
- The Office hardening baseline and accompanying scripts are referenced as part of the Intune Office hardening guidance. See the script links above for remote references.[^1]
- The baseline and script-based approaches are intended to prevent standard users from changing Office security settings after deployment. See the referenced baseline documentation for details.[^2]
