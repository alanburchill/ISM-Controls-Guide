## Summary

Backups of data, applications, and settings are performed and retained in accordance with business criticality and business continuity requirements.[^1] Microsoft 365 Backup protects Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business with 1-year retention and fast restore, with backups stored within the Microsoft 365 data boundary and protected by append-only, immutable restore points.[^2] Azure Backup covers on-premises and cloud workloads; the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent backs up files, folders, and system state and can integrate with on-premises Azure Backup Server (MABS) or System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM).[^1] Follow the Microsoft 365 Backup setup guidance to enable and configure backups in your tenant.[^4]

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Adopt a multi-target backup design aligned with business criticality. Workstations will have Windows Backup and Restore enabled with the restore page shown, and OneDrive for Business will be automatically enabled with Known Folder Backup. On-Prem Servers and Azure VMs will be protected using the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services agent (with DPM or Azure Backup Server integration as applicable), and Microsoft 365 data will be backed up and restorable via Microsoft 365 Backup for SharePoint, Exchange Online, and OneDrive.
