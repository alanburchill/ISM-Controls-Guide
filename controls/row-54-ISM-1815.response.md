## Summary

Event logs must be protected from unauthorized modification and deletion to preserve audit trails and support forensic investigations.[^1]

Implement RBAC in Defender XDR and Sentinel to control access to logs and prevent tampering, leveraging the Unified RBAC model and the ability to create custom roles and scoped permissions.[^2][^3]

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Enable and enforce RBAC in Defender XDR and Microsoft Sentinel to limit access to event logs, protecting them from tampering.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Not provided in source documentation.
* **Permissions/Roles:** Global Administrator or Security Administrator in Microsoft Entra ID is required to access Permissions and roles in the Defender portal. To create a custom RBAC role, you must have Authorization permissions in Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC. [^3]
* **Dependencies:** Not provided in source documentation.

## Implementation Steps

### RBAC-based protection of event logs in Defender XDR and Sentinel

1. Create custom roles to restrict log access and log-management capabilities.
   - Sign in to the Defender portal.
   - In the navigation pane, choose Permissions > Roles > Create custom role.
   - On the Basics tab, enter the role name and an optional description, then select Next.
   - On the Choose permissions page, select:
     - Security operations
     - Security posture
     - Authorization and settings
     - Data Operations (Preview) (if Sentinel data lake integration is required)
   - For each permission group, adjust the Authorization and settings to scope permissions to the required areas and data sources.
   - If you select All read-only permissions or All read and manage permissions, note that any new permissions added to these categories are automatically included.
   - Select Apply, then Next to continue.
   - On the Assign users and data sources page, select Add assignment.
     - Assignment name: provide a descriptive name.
     - Employees: select Microsoft Entra security groups or individual users.
     - Data sources: choose the services where the assigned permissions should apply. If you granted read-only permissions for a single data source, access to other data sources remains restricted.
     - Data collections: leave as the default Sentinel data lake workspace or adjust as needed.
     - Enable Include future data sources automatically if required.
   - Select Next, review the role details, then Submit. [^1]

2. Create a dedicated role to access and manage roles and permissions (Authorization role).
   - Sign in to the Defender portal as Global Administrator or Security Administrator.
   - Permissions > Roles > Create custom role.
   - Basics: enter role name and description; Next.
   - Authorization and settings: choose Custom permissions.
   - Authorization: select either:
     - Select all permissions, or
     - Read-only
   - Select Apply, then Next to continue.
   - Assign users and data sources:
     - Add assignments with a descriptive Assignment name.
     - Data sources: choose all data sources or specific data sources (e.g., Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Sentinel data lake) as needed.
   - Assigned users and groups: add the appropriate users or groups; Next.
   - Review and Submit. [^1]

3. Activate the Defender XDR Unified RBAC model.
   - Activate workloads to use the Unified RBAC model in Defender XDR to enforce the configured roles and assignments.
   - Refer to the activation guidance for exact steps. [^2]

4. Optional: Configure scoped access for Defender for Identity and Defender for Cloud.
   - Use Unified RBAC to restrict Defender for Identity access to specific Active Directory domains or OUs.
   - Configure scoped roles for Defender for Cloud to limit access to subscriptions, resource groups, or individual resources.
   - See Defender XDR RBAC documentation for scoped-access details. [^1]

5. Activate and verify enforcement.
   - Ensure the Unified RBAC model is active for the targeted workloads to enforce the new roles.
   - Verify that only authorized users can view and manage event logs within Defender XDR and Sentinel. [^2]

Notes
- RBAC in Defender XDR and Sentinel enables granular access control over security data and controls, reducing the risk of tampering with event logs. [^1]
