## Implementation Steps

### Regular EOS software inventory review and removal

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal, locate software with end-of-support status:
   - If you're a preview customer, navigate to Exposure management > Recommendations, then select Vulnerabilities on the left. [^1]
   - If you're an existing customer, navigate to Endpoints > Vulnerability management > Recommendations. [^1]

2. Add a Filters: Tags; select one or more EOS tag options; click Apply. [^1]

3. Review the resulting list of software/versions with end-of-support status; identify items to remove or replace. [^1]

4. Open a version entry to view its end-of-support date. The drill-down opens and shows the end-of-support date. [^1]

5. Decide whether to update or remove the identified software from the organization. [^1]

6. Use the current deployment mechanism to remove the application as required. [^1]
