## Summary

Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to enable vulnerability scanning of firmware[^3]. Then access the security portal's Exposure management path: Exposure management > Vulnerability management > Vulnerabilities to view CVEs, exposure, and remediation guidance[^1]. The Defender Vulnerability Management experience includes hardware and firmware inventories and remediation workflows accessible through Exposure Management[^5].

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Then use the Microsoft Defender security portal report under Exposure management > Vulnerabilities to monitor and remediate vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** MDVM features require appropriate Microsoft Defender licensing (Defender for Endpoint P1); Defender for Cloud licensing is recommended for full cloud vulnerability visibility. [^1]
* **Permissions/Roles:** Use established MDVM permissions or the new unified Exposure Management RBAC roles. [^2]
* **Dependencies:** Endpoints must be onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. [^3]

## Implementation Steps

### Onboard devices to Defender for Endpoint and access Vulnerabilities report

1. Create a new Windows Configuration Profile with a type of Template > Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (desktop devices running Windows 10 or later).[^4]
2. Set Expedite telemetry reporting frequency to Enable.[^4]
3. Assign the profile to a group containing all applicable Windows devices.[^4]
4. In the Microsoft Defender portal, navigate to Exposure management > Vulnerability management > Vulnerabilities to view the vulnerabilities list and related details.[^1]
