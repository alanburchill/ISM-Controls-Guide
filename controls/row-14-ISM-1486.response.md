## Summary

Java isn't installed by default on Windows 10 or Windows 11. Web browsers do not process Java from the internet. Use Microsoft Edge and deploy ACSC Edge Hardening Guidelines to enforce these protections, aligning with the ISM-1486 requirement.

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Java will not be installed on endpoints, and Microsoft Edge will be the primary browser configured per ACSC Edge Hardening Guidelines. Internet Explorer 11 will be disabled or removed; IE mode in Edge may be used for legacy sites if necessary.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Not provided in source documentation. [^1]
* **Permissions/Roles:** Not provided in source documentation. [^1]
* **Dependencies:** Java isn't installed by default on Windows 10 or Windows 11; Microsoft Edge should be deployed and hardened per ACSC Edge Hardening Guidelines and Edge Baseline; Intune/Endpoint Manager is used to deploy the Edge Baseline; Windows 10/11 as the target OS. [^1]

## Implementation Steps

### Web browser hardening for Java applets (ISM-1486)

1. Navigate to Endpoint Security > Security Baselines > Microsoft Edge Baseline in the Intune console. [^1]

2. Create a new Microsoft Edge Baseline by selecting Create Profile. [^1]

3. Review the configuration, and assign the Security Baseline to a group. [^1]

4. Save the ACSC Edge Hardening Guidelines policy to your local device and import it into Intune:
   - Save the policy file: [ACSC Edge Hardening Guidelines.json](https://github.com/microsoft/Intune-ACSC-Windows-Hardening-Guidelines/blob/main/edge/policies/ACSC%20Edge%20Hardening%20Guidelines.json) to your local device. [^2]
   - In Intune, navigate to Devices > Windows > Configuration profiles > Create > Import Policy and import the saved policy file. [^2]
   - Name the policy, browse for the file under Policy file, and click Save. [^2]

5. Deploy the Microsoft Edge Baseline to a group:
   - Review and assign the Edge Baseline to a deployment group. [^1]

6. Internet Explorer (IE) mitigation: disable Internet Explorer 11 as a standalone browser when needed.
   - Create a new Settings Catalog policy. [^1]
   - Browse by category, and search for: Disable Internet Explorer 11 as a standalone browser (User). [^1]
   - Go to Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Internet Explorer and select the setting: Disable Internet Explorer 11 as a standalone browser (User). [^1]
   - Enable the setting Disable Internet Explorer 11 as a standalone browser (User). [^1]
   - Deploy the policy to a deployment group. [^1]

7. In addition, to completely remove Internet Explorer 11:
   - Add the UserApplicationHardening-RemoveFeatures.ps1 script as a PowerShell script with the following options:
     • Run this script using the logged on credentials: No
     • Enforce script signature check: No
     • Run script in 64-bit PowerShell Host: No
     - The script is hosted remotely: [UserApplicationHardening-RemoveFeatures.ps1](https://github.com/microsoft/Intune-ACSC-Windows-Hardening-Guidelines/blob/main/scripts/UserApplicationHardening-RemoveFeatures.ps1). [^3]
   - Assign the script to a deployment group. [^3]

Notes:
- Java isn’t installed by default on Windows 10/11, which supports this mitigation posture. If Java is present, remove or disable as part of the hardening workflow. [^1]
