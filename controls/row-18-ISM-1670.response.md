## Summary

PDF applications are blocked from creating child processes. Enable the ASR rule Block Adobe Reader from creating child processes via an Intune Attack Surface Reduction policy to enforce this restriction. This implements PDF hardening guidance by preventing Adobe Reader from spawning child processes.

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Enable the ASR rule to block Adobe Reader from creating child processes by deploying an Intune Attack Surface Reduction policy. This directly enforces the control described in ImplementationGuidance to prevent Adobe Reader from creating child processes.

## Implementation Steps

### Block Adobe Reader from creating child processes

1. In Intune, navigate to Endpoint Security > Attack Surface Reduction.
2. Create (or modify) a new Attack Surface Reduction Endpoint Security Policy.
3. Set Block Adobe Reader from creating child processes to Enable.
4. Assign the Attack Surface Reduction Rule policy to a group.[^1]
