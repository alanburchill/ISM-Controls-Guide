## Summary

Patch applications not in the excluded categories within one month of release using Intune deployment.[^1] Configure and enable Windows Autopatch for all workstations via the Intune admin portal. For third-party applications, deploy new versions via the Intune Enterprise Application Management catalog; otherwise repackage and redeploy updated applications within the required timeline.[^3][^4][^1] Configure Edge to use the Target Channel override, selecting Stable or Extended Stable to align with organizational policy.[^2]

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Windows Autopatch will be configured and enabled for all workstations via the Intune admin portal. For third-party applications, deploy updates by using the Intune Enterprise Application Catalogue; otherwise repackage and redeploy all applications requiring security updates within the timeline. Configure Edge to the Target Channel or Stable on all devices.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Windows Autopatch features require Business Premium or A3+ licenses. [^1]
* **Permissions/Roles:** Access to the Microsoft Intune admin center to configure Windows Autopatch and related update workflows. [^1]
* **Dependencies:**
  - Devices must be enrolled in Intune or managed using co-management (Intune + Configuration Manager). [^1]
  - For third-party applications patches, deploy new versions via Intune Enterprise Application Catalogue. [^2]
  - Edge browser must be configured to the Stable or Extended Stable channel; Edge channel management can be done via Group Policy or Intune. [^3]

## Implementation Steps

### Windows Autopatch configuration

1. Ensure all workstations are enrolled in Intune or managed via co-management. [^3]

2. In the Intune admin portal, configure Windows Autopatch and enable automatic updates for Windows devices. Include defining update rings and Autopatch groups as needed. [^3]

3. Use Intune reports to monitor the health and activity of endpoints and the Autopatch deployment. [^3]

### Third-party applications patching via Intune Enterprise App Catalogue

1. Identify third-party applications that require patches in line with ISM-1693 (patches for applications other than core categories are applied within one month of release). [^1]

2. Deploy new versions of the application via Intune Enterprise Application Catalogue. [^1]

3. If updates cannot be deployed through the catalogue, repackage and redeploy all applications that required security updates within the timeline. [^1]

### Edge browser channel configuration

1. Configure all devices to use the Target Channel override set to Stable (or Extended Stable if required) for Microsoft Edge. This is configured through the Edge update policies in Intune (Edge Update > Applications > Microsoft Edge). [^2]

2. If opting into Extended Stable, follow the Extended Stable guidance to set the Target Channel override accordingly. [^2]

3. Validate that Edge on devices reflects the selected channel (e.g., edge://settings/help shows the current channel). [^2]
