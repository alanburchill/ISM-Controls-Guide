## Summary

Backups of data, applications, and settings are retained in a secure and resilient manner by storing them in an Azure Recovery Services vault configured with geo-redundant storage.[^1][^3] Backup data at rest is encrypted by default using platform-managed keys, with an option to encrypt with customer-managed keys stored in Azure Key Vault.[^3] The solution also supports protective features such as soft delete and cross-region restore to enhance recoverability.[^3]

## Design Decision

> [!NOTE] Store backups in a Recovery Services vault with geo-redundant storage (GRS) and encryption enabled. Place the vault in the same region as the resources being backed up; enable Cross Region Restore for disaster recovery across Azure paired regions as needed.

## Prerequisites

* **Licensing:** Not provided in source documentation.
* **Permissions/Roles:** Azure RBAC roles for backup management are required: Backup Contributor, Backup Reader, and Backup Operator. Ensure Multi-User Authorization (MUA) is used for destructive operations where applicable. [^2]
* **Dependencies:** 
  - An Azure subscription and sign-in to Azure using an account with permissions to manage Recovery Services vaults and backups; Azure PowerShell Az 1.0 or later. [^1]
  - A Recovery Services vault must be created in the same region as the resource to be backed up, with storage redundancy configured to Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS) by default. [^3]
  - The Backup Agent must be installed on the VM to be backed up (or ensure preinstalled via image). [^3]

## Implementation Steps

### Azure Backup Vault with Geo-Redundancy and Encryption

1. Create a Recovery Services vault for the VM in the same region as the VM.
2. Verify the vault’s storage replication. Open the vault, navigate to Properties, then Backup Configuration, and confirm that geo-redundant storage (GRS) is selected by default. This ensures backups are replicated to a secondary datacenter. The sample script demonstrates setting storage redundancy to GeoRedundant.[^3][^1]
3. Configure the backup policy and select the VM from the vault UI.
4. Ensure the VM has the Backup Agent installed. If the VM was created from an Azure gallery image, the agent is already installed; otherwise, install the VM agent as described in the VM backup preparation guidance.[^3]
5. Run the backup according to the policy. If needed, trigger the first backup manually from the vault dashboard.[^3]
6. Encryption configuration
   - 6.1 By default, backup data is encrypted using platform-managed keys. No action required for baseline protection.[^3]
   - 6.2 To use customer-managed keys (CMK), configure encryption with keys stored in Azure Key Vault and grant the Recovery Services vault access to the key. See the CMK guidance for detailed steps. [CMK guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/encryption-at-rest-with-cmk).[^3][^2]
7. For automation purposes, reference the PowerShell sample that demonstrates setting up a Geo-Redundant vault and encrypted VM backup. [PowerShell Script Sample - Back up an Azure VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/scripts/backup-powershell-sample-backup-encrypted-vm).[^1]
